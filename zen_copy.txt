The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

1. Although never is often better than *right* now.
2. Although practicality beats purity.
3. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
4. Beautiful is better than ugly.
5. Complex is better than complicated.
6. Errors should never pass silently.
7. Explicit is better than implicit.
8. Flat is better than nested.
9. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
10. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
11. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
12. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those.
13. Now is better than never.
14. Readability counts.
15. Simple is better than complex.
16. Sparse is better than dense.
17. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
18. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
19. Unless explicitly silenced.
